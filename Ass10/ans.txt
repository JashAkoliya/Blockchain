1. Are Higher Order functions and Call back functions the same ? If not,
briefly explain about both functions.
-> No callback function and high order function is not same.
   ->Callback function:- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument.
   ->Highorder function:- High order function is a function that take one or more function as argument and return function as the result.

2. Is filter a Higher Order function in Javascript ? If yes, why ?
-> Yes filter is highorder function. filter function take one or more function as argument or return function as the result.
   The filter function takes callback function as an argument and applies that function to each element of an array, returning a new array that contain only the elements for which the callback function return true.

3. Give an example of a Higher Order function and a call back function
used in the same program.
-> 
    function callBack(){
        console.log("I am callback function");
    }
    function highOrder(func){
        console.log("I am high order function");
        func();
    }
    highOrder(callBack);

4. Carefully check the example below:

       Otherwise Output:-
       //Hello John
       //Hello Tina
       //Hello Kale
       //Hello Max

    b) Which function is a Higher Order function here ?
    -> useFunction(arr,fn) is a Highorder function.
